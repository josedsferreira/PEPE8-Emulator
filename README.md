# PEPE-8 Emulator

## Description

The PEPE-8 Emulator is a program that emulates the operation of the PEPE-8 computer architecture.
It allows you to load and execute programs written in the PEPE-8 assembly language and provides a  graphical user interface to visualize the operation of the processor, including the state of the registers, memory, and program execution.

## Features

- Assembler of PEPE-8 Assembly code capable of converting the code into binary code
- Emulation of the behaviour of the PEPE-8 processor
- Simple graphical user interface for easy interaction and visualization of the state of the registers, flags, multiplexers and data and instruction memories.

## Graphical engine

To display the GUI, the olcPixelGameEngine library created by OneLoneCoder was used.

## Usage

1. Write the assembly code program in the assembly_program.txt .
2. Run Emulator.exe .
2. Use the spacebar to step through the instructions one by one.
4. Press 'R' to reset the processor's state.

## Acknowledgments

This PEPE-8 Emulator is based on the PEPE-8 architecture and assembly language. Credit to the original authors of the PEPE-8 architecture and the olcPixelGameEngine library for enabling this emulator's creation.
